### Code

- ***Important note about source code:*** Only the project src directory and the platform.ini files will be uploaded to GitHub in order to decrease clutter and only contain the necessary code. To use these examples it is expected you know how to setup your PlatformIO environment. If you do not know how to do this please refer to the file in the Documentation directory!

## Documentation

- Within the Documentation directory you will find datasheets for commonly used components & microcontrollers as well as diagrams for more complex projects. There will also be instructions for setting up your development environment to get started programming!
